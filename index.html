          For this semester I'm planning to do well in all of my class, and I'm planning to work hard in all of them.
          Because I wanted to take a humanities class that would be useful in the long term, I decided to enroll in this class.
          I've never learned about mobile responsive design and I feel that Professor Stolley will teach it in an easy way.

          In my free time I enjoy going out, coding, exploring new cultures, or catching up with the last entrepreneurial success stories in the technical field.
          For a while I've reading about ICO stories.
