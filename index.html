    <h2>Calin Segarceanu</h2>
      <div id="main">
      <p>
        I am Calin Segarceanu. I was born and raised in Romania.
        I lived my entire in the capital of Romania.
        Back in the 40s it used the be called the Small Paris.
        <br> In Bucharest I went to a high school that heavily emphasized classes in mathematics and computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's one of the reasons that made me pick computer science as my main major.
        <br>The large number of jobs in this field also weighted in my decision.
        <br>Always thinking about the future, I am trying to decide between a co-terminal in applied mathematics or computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the summer I worked for a medical startup. However I feel enjoy working more with numbers, so the finance or insurance industry seem a pretty good fit.
        This is would be the main reason for doing a master in applied mathematics.

      <p>
          For this semester I'm planning to do well in all of my class, and I'm planning to work hard in all of them.
          Because I wanted to take a humanities class that would be useful in the long term, I decided to enroll in this class.
          I've never learned about mobile responsive design and I feel that Professor Stolley will teach it in an easy way.
      </p>
      <p>
          In my free time I enjoy going out, coding, exploring new cultures, or catching up with the last entrepreneurial success stories in the technical field.
          For a while I've reading about ICO stories.

        On campus I am involved in the Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
        I decided to join "Skulls" mostly because of their core values.
