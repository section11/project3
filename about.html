      <p>
        I am Calin Segarceanu. I was born and raised in Romania.
        I lived my entire life in the capital of Romania, Bucharest.
        Back in the 40s it used to be called the Small Paris.
        In Bucharest I went to a high school that heavily emphasized classes in mathematics and computer science.

        That's one of the reasons that made me pick computer science as my main major.
        The large number of jobs in this field also weighted in my decision.
        I decided to pursue a master in data science because it is the best mix between mathematics and computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past year I worked for a medical startup. However I feel that I enjoy working more with numbers, so the finance or the insurance industry seem a better fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy going out, coding, exploring new places and cultures, or catching up with the latest entrepreneurial success stories in the technical field.
        In the past few weeks I've been trying to understand more about the blockchain technology.
